# Asimov 1 Locomotion

Asimov 1 is an open-source humanoid robot developed by
[Menlo Research](https://menlo.ai/). This repository provides the
training and evaluation code for its locomotion policies, so you can
train policies in simulation and deploy them to the real robot.

## Isaac Asimov

Standalone Isaac Lab extension for training Asimov-1 locomotion policies with
PPO and adversarial motion priors (AMP).

## Quick Install

For a brand-new machine with no existing Isaac Lab setup, run the install
script from the project root. It sets up a uv-managed environment, pulls the
pinned Isaac Lab and `asimov-1` submodules, and installs everything needed
to train and play. Prerequisites: Ubuntu 22.04+ (x86_64), a compatible
NVIDIA driver, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed, and `sudo` access
(used to install `cmake`/`build-essential`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/menloresearch/isaac_asimov.git
cd isaac_asimov
./quick_install.sh
```

### Advanced Install

If you already have your own Isaac Lab checkout you want
to reuse, want conda instead of uv, or just want to understand what each
install step does: **[Advanced Install](INSTALL.md)**.

## Train

Before starting a training run, run a quick test to ensure the full pipeline is functional. The following code will fire off a short training run with a small number of environments which should take ~10 minutes on a 4090.

**Quick Test**

This is a small job to see if the full training code is working. These settings should work for most gpus and finished relatively quickly.

```bash
./isaac_asimov.sh --train \
    --task Asimov1-Velocity-AMP-v0 --num_envs 128 --headless --max_iterations 100
```

### Single GPU Training Run

Use this code to replicate the training run for our baseline policy using a single gpu.

**AMP (recommended)**

```bash
./isaac_asimov.sh --train \
    --task Asimov1-Velocity-AMP-v0 --num_envs 4096 --headless
```

**Plain PPO baseline**

```bash
./isaac_asimov.sh --train \
    --task Asimov1-Velocity-v0 --num_envs 4096 --headless
```

Useful flags: `--max_iterations <n>`, `--seed <n>`, `--video` (record rollout
clips during training).

Note: We use 4096 `num_envs` to train our baseline locomotion policy using A6000 or pro 6000. If you hit any out of memory errors, consider lowering the `num_envs`. However, this means that the policy may take longer to converge or may be less stable for the same number of iterations.

### Multi-GPU Training Run

This code runs training via `--distributed` with two GPUs and 4096 environments per GPU. You should adjust the parameters according to the compute available to you.

```bash
python -m torch.distributed.run --standalone --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=2 \
    scripts/rsl_rl/train.py \
    --task Asimov1-Velocity-AMP-v0 --num_envs 4096 --headless --distributed
```

## Play / Evaluate

Load the latest checkpoint and visualize the trained policy:

```bash
./isaac_asimov.sh --play \
    --task Asimov1-Velocity-AMP-Play-v0 --num_envs 32
```

Use `--checkpoint <path>` to select a specific checkpoint (`--target` is an
alias), or `--onnx-output <path>` for an extra ONNX export.

Checkpoints and logs are written to `logs/rsl_rl/<experiment_name>/<run>/`.

## Troubleshooting
The training code has been tested on the following GPUs:
- NVIDIA RTX A6000
- NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000
- NVIDIA RTX 4090
- NVIDIA RTX 3090
